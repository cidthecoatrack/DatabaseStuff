Our database is for a stat tracking website. The database stores data pertaining to NFL players and their stats.  The application specifications are as follows: 
1.	The database will keep track of players and their stats (game, season, and career)
2.	Keep track of records of stats
3.	Which players play for which team and when will be recorded
4.	Team stats should also be recorded
5.	Coaches (basic stats only – win/loss, team and year)
6.	Money-related stats (player salaries, team cap room, etc.)
7.	All stats recorded per season
8.	Intentions:
a.	Keep track of milestones (quarterback getting 50,000 passing yards, undefeated seasons, etc.)
b.	Be able to extract players to make fantasy teams (think all-star teams in Madden)
c.	Be able to report on stats (the website will show graphs of various reports, as well as tables)
