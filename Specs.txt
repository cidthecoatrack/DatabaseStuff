Our database is for a stat tracking website. The database stores data pertaining to NFL players and their stats.  The application specifications are as follows: 
1.	The database will keep track of players and their stats (game, season, and career)
2.	Keep track of records of stats
3.	Which players play for which team and when will be recorded
4.	Team stats should also be recorded
5.	Coaches (basic stats only – win/loss, team and year)
6.	Money-related stats (player salaries, team cap room, etc.)
7.	All stats recorded per season
8.	Intentions:
a.	Keep track of milestones (quarterback getting 50,000 passing yards, undefeated seasons, etc.)
b.	Be able to extract players to make fantasy teams (think all-star teams in Madden)
c.	Be able to report on stats (the website will show graphs of various reports, as well as tables)

Intermediary relations:
	GameId (GUID) to GID
	PlayerId (GUID) to PLAYER

What we will model (all stats are per game, per season, and per career):
	Games
		GameId
		SeasonId						(foreign key to seasons table)
	Season
		SeasonId
		BeginningYear
		EndYear							(contraint to be 1 higher than beginning year)
•	Players							(This is a table - should be things with only 1 value at a time)

		Inside 20						SELECT COUNT(*) FROM PUNTS WHERE (SELECT YFOG FROM CORE, PUNTS WHERE PUNTS.PID = CORE.PID) + (SELECT PNET FROM PUNTS WHERE PUNTER = PLAYER) > 80
		Team							OFFENSE.TEAM WHERE GID = GameId
•	Teams							(This is a table)
		GameId							(foreign key)

We will model these stats, and ONLY these stats (unless we decide to add more, so there).  These are the minimum of stats we hope to model.  We will be working equally as partners, both as designers and coders.
